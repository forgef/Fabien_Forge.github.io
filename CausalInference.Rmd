Many of the research projects I have worked on and many of the courses that I have taught have their heart causal inference. I am passionate about this aspect of statistics because it mixes technical considerations with intuitions. What constitutes a convincing identification strategy is rarely rooted in fancy statistical tools but a well thought of understanding of the underlying process. Below are a few examples of me using or teaching these tools.
