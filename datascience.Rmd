# [Statistics for Causal Inference](CausalInference.html)
Half of my empirical work uses causal inference and I taught several classes using causal inference.

# [Deep Learning for Data Collection](MachineLearning.html) 
I am currently using convolutional neural network and transfer learning to map the evolution of urban tree canopy in large cities in Canada using satellite images

# [Machine Learning for prediction](MachineLearning.html)
I have several projects using prediction and machine learning tools. I also [taught machine learning](teaching.html) to 4th year undergraduates.


# [Geospatial Data](geospatial.html) {#GS}
A lot of my work uses geospatial information, weather, pollution, tree location etc. and I have used extensively softwares such as arcGIS and Python libraries such as Geopandas, Rasterio, NetCDF, xarray etc.
