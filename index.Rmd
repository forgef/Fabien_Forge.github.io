[Jason Garred](http://web5.uottawa.ca/www5/jasongarred/index.html), co-supervisor: Jason is working on development economics and trade. He has played a key role in the design of my Ph.D. as supervisor, co-author and by hiring me as a research assistant for his own project. Last but not least his support extends way beyond the traditional supervisor-supervisee relationship.

[Abel Brodeur](https://sites.google.com/site/abelbrodeur/home?authuser=0), co-supervisor: Abel's research interests include applied economics (development, crime, sex) as well as economics replication and methodology. He too has played a key role in the design of my papers and the overall advancement of my Ph.D.. Whenever he is disagreeing with Jason, I have the luxury of being left with two excellent pieces of advice.

[Carolyn Fischer](https://www.rff.org/people/carolyn-fischer/): Carolyn joined the university of Ottawa as a Canada 150 Research Chair in Climate Economics, Innovation and Policy. She has provided me with very useful insights on the environmental and theoretical dimensions of my work. She also played a determinant role in my ability to visit UC Berkeley.

[Anthony Heyes](https://anthonyheyes.wordpress.com/): Anthony holds the Tier 1 Canada Research Chair (CRC) in Environmental Economics and is a Full professor at the university of Ottawa. His experience and keen eye have greatly helped me improving the quality of my work.

[Maya Papineau](https://sites.google.com/site/mayapapineau/home): Maya is an Assistant Professor of Economics at Carleton University. Her research interests are in Environmental Economics, Energy Economics, and Applied Econometrics. She too has brought valuable insights into my work.
