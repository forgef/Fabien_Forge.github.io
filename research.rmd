Previously presented under the title: Hedging Climate Change: Yield Volatility, Crop Choice and Trade <br>

<div style="text-align: justify">One way in which climate change may affect poorly insured farmers in developing countries is through its impact on yield volatility. First, volatility could influence the extent to which farmers adapt to climate change though changes in planting decisions: if crops with smaller falls in expected yields are also subject to greater yield volatility, risk-averse farmers may not substitute towards these to the extent predicted by existing research. Second, changes in the volatility of the returns to farmers' portfolios of crops could also have a direct effect on farmers' welfare. We study the potential importance of these issues in the case of India. To do so, we employ a general equilibrium trade model with portfolio choice, which allows us to study these projected effects in a general equilibrium environment in which the changing conditions of farmers in other nearby locations are also important. Our findings suggest that on average across Indian districts, neither of the two potential issues proposed above is of first-order importance.</div>

<font size="3">[<b>When are Tariff Cuts Not Enough? Heterogeneous Effects of Trade Preferences for the Least Developed Countries</b>]()</font> 

with [Jason Garred](http://web5.uottawa.ca/www5/jasongarred/index.html) and Kyae Lim Kwon

<div style="text-align: justify">
We study the impact of a large set of recent reforms to trade preferences for the least developed countries (LDCs).  In the late 1990s and early 2000s, OECD countries greatly expanded their LDC trade preference programs, cutting tariffs on imports from LDCs to zero for a wide range of products.  We show that these tariff reductions had a small positive average effect, but also that the breadth of their impact was strikingly limited.  New export relationships (by importer-exporter-product) were stimulated only in cases with previous 'export experience', where countries already exported the same product to an OECD country or exported a similar product to the same importer.  Tariff cuts for LDCs thus led to increases in trade flow survival and `sequential exporting', but made no other progress in reducing the overwhelming prevalence of zero trade flows in LDCs' export portfolios.

<font size="3">[<b>CCTs and Fertility: Long-Term Impacts Across Two Generations</b>]()</font> 

<div style="text-align: justify">The Mexican conditional cash transfer program Progresa, started in 1997, has been found to have positively impacted many aspects of the lives of the poor in Mexico both in the short and long run. The few studies that used the initial randomization over the first 18 to 24 months failed to observe any change in fertility decisions. Using the IPUMS census survey, I construct two cohorts of women that I observe in 2010, 13 years after the program started. The older cohort mainly benefited from a reduction in the cost of quality of their children, while the younger cohort benefited, in addition, from a schooling treatment on themselves. The results from a difference-in-difference identification strategy suggest a significant negative effect on fertility in a fashion consistent with what Beckerâ€™s quality-quantity trade-off model predicts. Although, both cohorts reduced their fertility, no additional effect was found on the fertility of the younger cohort in the early part of their fertility window </div>
